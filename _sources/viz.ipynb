    "# Effective data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "This chapter will introduce concepts and tools relating to data visualization\n",
    "beyond what we have seen and practiced so far.  We will focus on guiding\n",
    "principles for effective data visualization and explaining visualizations\n",
    "independent of any particular tool or programming language.  In the process, we\n",
    "will cover some specifics of creating visualizations (scatter plots, bar\n",
    "plots, line plots, and histograms) for data using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a data set and a question, select from the above plot types and use Python to create a visualization that best answers the question.\n",
    "- Given a visualization and a question, evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization and suggest improvements to better answer the question.\n",
    "- Referring to the visualization, communicate the conclusions in non-technical terms.\n",
    "- Identify rules of thumb for creating effective visualizations. \n",
    "- Define the two key aspects of altair objects:\n",
    "    - mark objects\n",
    "    - encodings\n",
    "- Use the altair library in Python to create and refine the above visualizations using:\n",
    "    - mark objects: mark_point, mark_line, mark_bar\n",
    "    - encodings : x, y, fill, color, shape\n",
    "    - subplots: facet\n",
    "- Describe the difference in raster and vector output formats.\n",
    "- Use `chart.save()` to save visualizations in `.png` and `.svg` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the visualization\n",
    "#### *Ask a question, and answer it* {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a visualization is to answer a question\n",
    "\\index{question!visualization} about a data set of interest. So naturally, the\n",
    "first thing to do **before** creating a visualization is to formulate the\n",
    "question about the data you are trying to answer.  A good visualization will\n",
    "clearly answer your question without distraction; a *great* visualization will\n",
    "suggest even what the question was itself without additional explanation.\n",
    "Imagine your visualization as part of a poster presentation for a project; even\n",
    "if you aren't standing at the poster explaining things, an effective\n",
    "visualization will convey your message to the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the different data analysis questions \n",
    "from Chapter \\@ref(intro). \n",
    "With the visualizations we will cover in this chapter, \n",
    "we will be able to answer *only descriptive and exploratory* questions. \n",
    "Be careful to not answer any *predictive, inferential, causal* \n",
    "*or mechanistic* questions with the visualizations presented here, \n",
    "as we have not learned the tools necessary to do that properly just yet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with most coding tasks, it is totally fine (and quite common) to make\n",
    "mistakes and iterate a few times before you find the right visualization for\n",
    "your data and question. There are many different kinds of plotting\n",
    "graphics available to use (see Chapter 5 of *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@wilkeviz] for a directory). \n",
    "The types of plot that we introduce in this book are shown in Figure \\@ref(fig:plot-sketches);\n",
    "which one you should select depends on your data \n",
    "and the question you want to answer. \n",
    "In general, the guiding principles of when to use each type of plot \n",
    "are as follows:\n",

    "- **scatter plots** visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables\n",
    "- **line plots** visualize trends with respect to an independent, ordered quantity (e.g., time)\n",

    "\n",
    "Just being able to make a visualization in Python with `altair` (or any other tool\n",
    "for that matter) doesn't mean that it effectively communicates your message to\n",
    "others. Once you have selected a broad type of visualization to use, you will\n",
    "have to refine it to suit your particular need.  Some rules of thumb for doing\n",
    "this are listed below. They generally fall into two classes: you want to \n",
    "*make your visualization convey your message*, and you want to *reduce visual noise*\n",
    "as much as possible. Humans have limited cognitive ability to process\n",
    "information; both of these types of refinement aim to reduce the mental load on\n",
    "your audience when viewing your visualization, making it easier for them to\n",
    "understand and remember your message quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convey the message**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the visualization answers the question you have asked most simply and plainly as possible.\n",
    "- Use legends and labels so that your visualization is understandable without reading the surrounding text.\n",
    "- Ensure the text, symbols, lines, etc., on your visualization are big enough to be easily read.\n",
    "- Ensure the data are clearly visible; don't hide the shape/distribution of the data behind other objects (e.g.,  a bar).\n",
    "- Make sure to use color schemes that are understandable by those with\n",
    "  colorblindness (a surprisingly large fraction of the overall \n",
    "  population&mdash;from about 1% to 10%, depending on sex and ancestry [@deebblind]).\n",
    "  For example, [Color Schemes](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/) \n",
    "  provides the ability to pick such color schemes, and you can check\n",
    "  your visualizations after you have created them by uploading to online tools\n",
    "  such as a [color blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).\n",
    "- Redundancy can be helpful; sometimes conveying the same message in multiple ways reinforces it for the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimize noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use colors sparingly. Too many different colors can be distracting, create false patterns, and detract from the message. \n",
    "- Be wary of overplotting. Overplotting is when marks that represent the data\n",
    "  overlap, and is problematic as it prevents you from seeing how many data\n",
    "  points are represented in areas of the visualization where this occurs. If your\n",
    "  plot has too many dots or lines and starts to look like a mess, you need to do\n",
    "  something different.\n",
    "- Only make the plot area (where the dots, lines, bars are) as big as needed. Simple plots can be made small.\n",
    "- Don't adjust the axes to zoom in on small differences. If the difference is small, show that it's small!"

    "    - To create an aesthetic mapping, we use the `aes` function.\n",
    "    - Here, we set the plot `x` axis to the `date_measured` variable, and the plot `y` axis to the `ppm` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **geometric object**, which specifies \\index{aesthetic mapping} how the mapped data should be displayed.\n",
    "    - To create a geometric object, we use a `geom_*` function (see the [ggplot reference](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/) for a list of geometric objects).\n",

    "Scatter plot of percentage of Canadians reporting a language as their mother tongue vs the primary language at home.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:03-mother-tongue-vs-most-at-home-scale-props) is the appropriate\n",
    "visualization to use to answer the first question in this section, i.e.,\n",
    "whether there is a relationship between the percentage of people who speak \n",
    "a language as their mother tongue and the percentage for whom that\n",
    "is the primary language spoken at home.\n",
    "To fully answer the question, we need to use\n",
    " Figure \\@ref(fig:03-mother-tongue-vs-most-at-home-scale-props)\n",
    "to assess a few key characteristics of the data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Direction:** if the y variable tends to increase when the x variable increases, then y has a **positive** relationship with x. If \n",
    "  y tends to decrease when x increases, then y has a **negative** relationship with x. If y does not meaningfully increase or decrease \n",
    "  as x increases, then y has **little or no** relationship with x. \\index{relationship!positive, negative, none}\n",
    "- **Strength:** if the y variable *reliably* increases, decreases, or stays flat as x increases,\n",
    "  then the relationship is **strong**. Otherwise, the relationship is **weak**. Intuitively, \\index{relationship!strong, weak}\n",
    "  the relationship is strong when the scatter points are close together and look more like a \"line\" or \"curve\" than a \"cloud.\"\n",
    "- **Shape:** if you can draw a straight line roughly through the data points, the relationship is **linear**. Otherwise, it is **nonlinear**. \\index{relationship!linear, nonlinear}\n",
    "\n",
    "In Figure \\@ref(fig:03-mother-tongue-vs-most-at-home-scale-props), we see that \n",
    "as the percentage of people who have a language as their mother tongue increases, \n",
    "so does the percentage of people who speak that language at home. \n",
    "Therefore, there is a **positive** relationship between these two variables.\n",
    "Furthermore, because the points in Figure \\@ref(fig:03-mother-tongue-vs-most-at-home-scale-props) \n",
    "are fairly close together, and the points look more like a \"line\" than a \"cloud\",\n",
    "we can say that this is a **strong** relationship. \n",
    "And finally, because drawing a straight line through these points in \n",
    "Figure \\@ref(fig:03-mother-tongue-vs-most-at-home-scale-props)\n",
    "would fit the pattern we observe quite well, we say that the relationship is **linear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Onto the second part of our exploratory data analysis question!\n",
    "Recall that we are interested in knowing whether the strength \n",
    "of the relationship we uncovered \n",
    "in Figure \\@ref(fig:03-mother-tongue-vs-most-at-home-scale-props) depends\n",
    "on the higher-level language category (Official languages, Aboriginal languages,\n",
    "and non-official, non-Aboriginal languages).\n",
    "One common way to explore this\n",
    "is to color the data points on the scatter plot we have already created by\n",
    "group. For example, given that we have the higher-level language category for\n",
    "each language recorded in the 2016 Canadian census, we can color the points in\n",
    "our previous \n",
    "scatter plot to represent each language's higher-level language category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we want to distinguish the values according to the `category` group with\n",
    "which they belong.  We can add an argument to the `aes` function, specifying\n",
    "that the `category` column should color the points. Adding this argument will\n",
    "color the points according to their group and add a legend at the side of the\n",
    "plot."

    "Wow, impressive! These measurements of the speed of light from 1879 had errors around *0.05%* of the true speed. Figure \\@ref(fig:03-data-morley-hist-5) shows you that even though experiments 2 and 5 were perhaps the most accurate, all of the experiments did quite an \n",

    "#### Choosing a binwidth for histograms {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a histogram in R, the default number of bins used is 30.\n",
    "Naturally, this is not always the right number to use.\n",
    "You can set the number of bins yourself by using\n",
    "the `bins` argument in the `geom_histogram` geometric object.\n",
    "You can also set the *width* of the bins using the\n",
    "`binwidth` argument in the `geom_histogram` geometric object.\n",
    "But what number of bins, or bin width, is the right one to use? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there is no hard rule for what the right bin number\n",
    "or width is. It depends entirely on your problem; the *right* number of bins \n",
    "or bin width is \n",
    "the one that *helps you answer the question* you asked. \n",
    "Choosing the correct setting for your problem \n",
    "is something that commonly takes iteration.\n",
    "We recommend setting the *bin width* (not the *number of bins*) because\n",
    "it often more directly corresponds to values in your problem of interest. For example,\n",
    "if you are looking at a histogram of human heights,\n",
    "a bin width of 1 inch would likely be reasonable, while the number of bins to use is \n",
    "not immediately clear.\n",
    "It's usually a good idea to try out several bin widths to see which one\n",
    "most clearly captures your data in the context of the question\n",
    "you want to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense for how different bin widths affect visualizations, \n",
    "let's experiment with the histogram that we have been working on in this section.\n",
    "In Figure \\@ref(fig:03-data-morley-hist-binwidth),\n",
    "we compare the default setting with three other histograms where we set the \n",
    "`binwidth` to 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1.\n",
    "In this case, we can see that both the default number of bins \n",
    "and the binwidth of 0.01 are effective for helping answer our question.\n",
    "On the other hand, the bin widths of 0.001 and 0.1 are too small and too big, respectively."

    "#### *Tell a story* {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, your visualization will not be shown entirely on its own, but rather\n",
    "it will be part of a larger presentation.  Further, visualizations can provide\n",
    "supporting information for any aspect of a presentation, from opening to\n",
    "conclusion.  For example, you could use an exploratory visualization in the\n",
    "opening of the presentation to motivate your choice of a more detailed data\n",
    "analysis / model, a visualization of the results of your analysis to show what\n",
    "your analysis has uncovered, or even one at the end of a presentation to help\n",
    "suggest directions for future work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of where it appears, a good way to discuss your visualization \\index{visualization!explanation} is as\n",
    "a story: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Establish the setting and scope, and describe why you did what you did. \n",
    "2) Pose the question that your visualization answers. Justify why the question is important to answer.\n",
    "3) Answer the question using your visualization. Make sure you describe *all* aspects of the visualization (including describing the axes). But you \n",
    "   can emphasize different aspects based on what is important to answer your question:\n",
    "    - **trends (lines):** Does a line describe the trend well? If so, the trend is *linear*, and if not, the trend is *nonlinear*. Is the trend increasing, decreasing, or neither?\n",
    "                        Is there a periodic oscillation (wiggle) in the trend? Is the trend noisy (does the line \"jump around\" a lot) or smooth?\n",
    "    - **distributions (scatters, histograms):** How spread out are the data? Where are they centered, roughly? Are there any obvious \"clusters\" or \"subgroups\", which would be visible as multiple bumps in the histogram?\n",
    "    - **distributions of two variables (scatters):** Is there a clear / strong relationship between the variables (points fall in a distinct pattern), a weak one (points fall in a pattern but there is some noise), or no discernible\n",
    "      relationship (the data are too noisy to make any conclusion)?\n",
    "    - **amounts (bars):** How large are the bars relative to one another? Are there patterns in different groups of bars? \n",
    "4) Summarize your findings, and use them to motivate whatever you will discuss next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are two examples of how one might take these four steps in describing the example visualizations that appeared earlier in this chapter.\n",
    "Each of the steps is denoted by its numeral in parentheses, e.g. (3).\n",

    "trap more heat from the sun, leading to global warming. (2) In order to assess\n",
    "how quickly the atmospheric concentration of CO$_{\\text{2}}$ is increasing over\n",
    "time, we (3) used a data set from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii,\n",
    "consisting of CO$_{\\text{2}}$ measurements from 1980 to 2020. We plotted the\n",
    "measured concentration of CO$_{\\text{2}}$ (on the vertical axis) over time (on\n",
    "the horizontal axis). From this plot, you can see a clear, increasing, and\n",
    "generally linear trend over time. There is also a periodic oscillation that\n",
    "occurs once per year and aligns with Hawaii's seasons, with an amplitude that\n",
    "is small relative to the growth in the overall trend. This shows that\n",
    "atmospheric CO$_{\\text{2}}$ is clearly increasing over time, and (4) it is\n",
    "perhaps worth investigating more into the causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Michelson Light Speed Experiments:** (1) \\index{Michelson speed of light} Our\n",
    "modern understanding of the physics of light has advanced significantly from\n",
    "the late 1800s when Michelson and Morley's experiments first demonstrated that\n",
    "it had a finite speed. We now know, based on modern experiments, that it moves at\n",
    "roughly 299,792.458 kilometers per second. (2) But how accurately were we first\n",
    "able to measure this fundamental physical constant, and did certain experiments\n",
    "produce more accurate results than others?  (3) To better understand this, we\n",
    "plotted data from 5 experiments by Michelson in 1879, each with 20 trials, as\n",
    "histograms stacked on top of one another.  The horizontal axis shows the\n",
    "accuracy of the measurements relative to the true speed of light as we know it\n",
    "today, expressed as a percentage.  From this visualization, you can see that\n",
    "most results had relative errors of at most 0.05%. You can also see that\n",
    "experiments 1 and 3 had measurements that were the farthest from the true\n",
    "value, and experiment 5 tended to provide the most consistently accurate\n",
    "result. (4) It would be worth further investigating the differences between\n",

    "## Additional resources\n",
    "- The [`ggplot2` R package page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) [@ggplot] is\n",
    "  where you should look if you want to learn more about the functions in this\n",
    "  chapter, the full set of arguments you can use, and other related functions.\n",
    "  The site also provides a very nice cheat sheet that summarizes many of the data\n",
    "  wrangling functions from this chapter.\n",
    "- The *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@wilkeviz] has\n",
    "  a wealth of information on designing effective visualizations. It is not\n",
    "  specific to any particular programming language or library. If you want to\n",
    "  improve your visualization skills, this is the next place to look.\n",
    "- *R for Data Science* [@wickham2016r] has a [chapter on creating visualizations using\n",
    "  `ggplot2`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html). This reference is\n",
    "  specific to R and `ggplot2`, but provides a much more detailed introduction to\n",
    "  the full set of tools that `ggplot2` provides. This chapter is where you should\n",
    "  look if you want to learn how to make more intricate visualizations in\n",
    "  `ggplot2` than what is included in this chapter.\n",
    "- The [`theme` function documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)\n",
    "  is an excellent reference to see how you can fine tune the non-data aspects \n",
    "  of your visualization.\n",
    "- *R for Data Science* [@wickham2016r] has a chapter on [dates and\n",
    "  times](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html).  This chapter is where\n",
    "  you should look if you want to learn about `date` vectors, including how to\n",
    "  create them, and how to use them to effectively handle durations, periods and\n",
    "  intervals using the `lubridate` package."
